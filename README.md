# Final Assignment

## Dust Particle Trajectory
The folder "Dust Particle Trajectory" contains:
1. The SageMath code which plots the required parametric plot, along with the derivation of the function being explained, (`Question 2.ipynb`)
2. The PDF export of the Jupyter notebook, (`Question 2.pdf`)

__I'd recommend reading the PDF first__, before opening the Jupyter notebook, in case you're interested in just understanding the working of the code, as it contains all of that information clearly. It is written logically, and with (hopefully) ample explanations. The Jupyter notebook requires you to have SageMath along with JSmol installed to be able to view the 3D plot properly.

## Conway's Game of Life
The folder "Conways Game of Life" contains:
1. The Octave code which implements the logic for the game in a Jupyter notebook along with an explanation in Markdown cells, (`Question 1.ipynb`)
2. The same code in a pure Octave format (.m file), (`Question 4.m`)
3. The 51 .png files generated as output of the Octave code, (`file_N.png`)
4. The .avi file generated from these pictures using ImageJ, (`Conway's Game of Life.avi`), and
5. The PDF export of the Jupyter notebook, (`Question 4.pdf`)

Again, __I'd recommend reading the PDF first__, before opening the Jupyter notebook, in case you're interested in understanding the working of the code, as it contains all of that information clearly. It is written logically and with (hopefully) ample explanations. 

You could alternatively try one of the following:
1. Run the Octave code in `Question 1.m` directly with Octave, and it should print out a new set of 51 .png files, which you could convert to a .avi file using ImageJ (or FIJI, as ImageJ is now known).
2. Open the Jupyter notebook using the Octave kernel, which you might have to install using `pip` or `conda`, whichever is applicable, and then play around with it.

## Locating a Point
The folder "Locating a Point" contains:
1. The SageMath code which finds the location of the point using the quadrant method described in the question, along with problem formulation, solution methodology, step-by-step explanations, and documentation, (`Question 5.ipynb`)
2. The user-defined `Plane` Python class in a script, `Plane.py`
3. The PDF export of the Jupyter notebook, (`Question 5.pdf`)

Yet again, __I'd recommend reading the PDF first__, before opening the Jupyter notebook, in case you're interested in understanding the working of the code, as it contains all of that information clearly. It is written logically and with (hopefully) ample explanations. You could also try opening the `Plane.py` file and see what it does, and read the provided documentation.
